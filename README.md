#  Hi, I'm Ng Yuan Da Elson! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack enthusiast who came from a background in game development. I am currently freelancing as a software developer whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
My current obsessions include designing reusable UI components like ShadCN and using TypeScript for the best DX.
